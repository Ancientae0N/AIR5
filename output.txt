President Trump lashed out Tuesday at the publication of questions that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III was said to be interested in asking him as part of the Russia probe and possible attempts to obstruct the inquiry . In a morning tweet , Trump said it was “disgraceful” that the 49 questions were provided to the New York Times , which published them Monday night . In his tweet , Trump also falsely asserts that there are no questions about “Collusion.” Among those is a query about Trump’s knowledge of any outreach by his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort to Russia “about potential assistance to the campaign.” A court filing this month revealed that Mueller had sought authorization to expand his probe into allegations that Manafort “committed a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials.” Another question asks about Trump’s knowledge of a June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower between his aides and a Russian lawyer who offered politically damaging information on Trump’s Democratic opponent , Hillary Clinton . And another asks what Trump knew about “Russian hacking , use of social media or other acts aimed at the campaign ? ” In his tweet , Trump calls collusion “a phony crime” and repeats his claim that none existed . The president also derides Mueller’s investigation as having “begun with illegally leaked classified information , ” adding : “Nice ! ”
